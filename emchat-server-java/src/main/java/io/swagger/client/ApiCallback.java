/**
 * Easemob REST APIs
 * Easemob Server REST API Swagger is designated to provide better documentation and thorough interfaces for testing. For more details about server implementation, request rate limitation, etc, please visit [Easemob Server Integration](http://docs.easemob.com/im/100serverintegration/10intro).    **Note:**  `org_ID` is the unique ID of the organization created when you first registered [Easemob console](https://console.easemob.com/).                          `app_name` is the unique app ID created when you new application in [Easemob console](https://console.easemob.com/).            `Authorization token` is required for most API requests as part of requesting header in the format `Bearer ${token}`. You can obtain the token via [/{org_name}/{app_name}/token](https://docs.hyphenate.io/docs/server-overview#section-request-authentication-token).
